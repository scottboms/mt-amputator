Amputator 1.2.1 for Movable Type
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amputator is a free plugin for Movable Type. It safely rewrites ampersand 
characters as an HTML entity reference: "&amp;".

If you want your HTML or XHTML to display smoothly across browsers and 
platforms, you need to use a little finesse with non-ASCII characters 
such as curly quotes, or "ä", or "™." On the web, I would have specified 
those last two characters by writing "&#xe4;" and "&#8482;." 

Sequences like "&#8482;" are called entity references, and their sole 
benefit is that they can be expressed in plain ASCII. HTML includes 
heaps of entity references to stand in for various accented and 
otherwise special characters not found in ASCII. Entity references 
all start with ampersands, and end with semicolons.

Unfortunately, X/HTML reserves the ampersand exclusively for entity 
references. Any time you use an ampersand by itself in HTML, for example, 
within the token delimiters of GET-style URLs, the parser will interpret 
it like the start of a nonexistent entity reference. Any decent browser 
will catch the error and recover, but it's still a mistake, and your 
HTML won't validate.

You can make your HTML clean again by replacing any ampersands with the 
entity reference for an ampersand. So instead of just "&", you'd write 
"&amp;", and the browser will make the last-minute substitution.

Amputator steps in to relieve you of the crushing, trivial burden of replacing 
all those ampersands yourself. After installation into Movable Type, you can 
freely gab about Law & Order and Brown & Williamson, and your ampersands will 
be replaced by entity references on the fly, as you publish.

Of course, Amputator is smart enough to ignore ampersands attached to existing 
entities. Otherwise, writing "&eacute;" would become "&amp;eacute;", and 
nobody likes that except the odd technical writer.

Installation
============
Amputator requires Movable Type version MT 4.x and newer.

1. Copy the Amputator folder into your Movable Type plugins directory. 
   If you don't have a plugins directory, create an empty directory named 
   "plugins" in your MT server root, alongside all the MT CGIs, and put 
   Amputator inside that new directory. In other words, your installation 
   should look like this:

   (MT home)/plugins/Amputator

2. Now it's time to edit your blog templates. Any tags that might contain 
   a stray ampersand should be modified to call encode_ampersands. 
   mt:EntryBody is an obvious place to start:

     <mt:EntryBody>

   becomes

     <mt:EntryBody encode_ampersands="1">

   Easy! Ditto for mt:EntryMore, or  mt:EntryTitle:

     <mt:EntryMore encode_ampersands="1">
     <mt:EntryTitle encode_ampersands="1">

   You're done.


Known Bugs
==========
I know of only one case where Amputator improperly replaces an ampersand: 
if you're using a JavaScript snippet inside of a weblog entry, Amputator may 
convert an ampersand intended for the JavaScript interpreter instead of the 
browser, confusing the interpreter. If this problem affects you, please let 
me know at the address below so we can discuss a solution.

Aside from that, if you encounter a problem, please send me a note and tell 
me all about it.

Version History
===============
1.2.1:  Wednesday, September 9, 2009
        Updated for Movable Type 4.x and newer, added a new plugin icon
        and removed Blosxom support.

1.2:    Friday, August 26, 2005
        Now compatible with Movable Type 3.2, as well as earlier versions.

        Blosxom already encodes ampersands when producing RSS, so Amputator 
        leaves Blosxom's RSS output alone. I also abandoned the cleaner 
        MT::Plugin namespace, because Blosxom couldn't handle it.

        Amputator now officially supports MT's dynamic publishing model 
        (thanks, Chad Everett).

1.1.1:  Mon, Feb 21, 2005
        No functional code changes, but Amputator now declares itself to MT 3 
        installations on the main menu page, and uses the sanctioned 
        MT::Plugin::Amputator package instead of the Amputator package. 
        Existing users should feel no pressure to upgrade unless they 
        enjoy looking at the plugin census.

        Also uses the MT::Plugin::Amputator package, instead of just Amputator.

1.1:    Tue, March 16, 2004
        Updated for Blosxom support.

1.0:    Thu, March 6, 2003
        Initial release.


Documentation revised September 9, 2009.

Additional Credits
==================
John Gruber (http://daringfireball.net) precipitated the release of this plugin
by providing several good reasons why he was unwilling to make SmartyPants take 
care if it for me.

Max Barry (http://maxbarry.com), whose novel "Jennifer Government" I quite 
enjoyed, suggested adding Blosxom support, and proposed the mechanism to 
exclude ampersand encoding from RSS output (when Blosxom handles the encoding 
by itself).

Grettir Asmundarson and Chad Everett contributed code.
